            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Evolution is the change in heritable traits of biological populations over successive generations. It is driven by mechanisms such as mutation, natural selection, genetic drift, migration (gene flow), and recombination. The modern synthesis unifies Darwinian natural selection with Mendelian genetics.</p>

            <p>Key vocabulary: gene, allele, genotype, phenotype, population, gene pool, fitness, selection, drift.</p>

            <h3>Checkpoint</h3>

                <li>Define 'allele' and explain how it differs from 'gene'.</li>

            <h2>Mendelian Genetics</h2>
            <p>Gregor Mendel's experiments showed that traits are inherited discretely through units we now call genes. Alleles may be dominant or recessive. In a simple monogenic trait with two alleles (A and a):</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Genotype examples: AA (homozygous dominant), Aa (heterozygous), aa (homozygous recessive).</li>
                <li>Phenotype depends on dominance relationships (complete dominance, incomplete dominance, codominance).</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Punnett squares are used to predict offspring genotypes from parental genotypes for monohybrid and dihybrid crosses. For a monohybrid cross Aa x Aa, expected genotypic ratio is 1:2:1 (AA:Aa:aa) and phenotypic ratio (if A is dominant) is 3:1.</p>

                <figcaption>Punnett square: monohybrid Aa x Aa (placeholder image)</figcaption>
            </div>

            <h3>Extensions</h3>
            <p>Dihybrid crosses (AaBb x AaBb) follow the independent assortment of genes located on different chromosomes, producing a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio under independent assortment and complete dominance.</p>

            <h3>Checkpoint</h3>
            <ol class="checkpoints">
                <li>Predict the genotypic and phenotypic ratios of a cross between two heterozygotes, Aa x Aa.</li>

                <li>Describe how a dihybrid cross would change if the two genes were linked (not independently assorting).</li>

            <h2>Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium & Allele Frequencies</h2>
            <p>The Hardy–Weinberg principle provides a mathematical baseline for allele frequencies in a non-evolving population. For a locus with two alleles, A and a, with frequencies p and q respectively:</p>

            <div class="formula">p + q = 1</div>
            <div class="formula">p<sup>2</sup> + 2pq + q<sup>2</sup> = 1</div>

            <p>Interpretation: p<sup>2</sup> is the expected frequency of AA, 2pq of Aa, and q<sup>2</sup> of aa. Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium requires: no selection, no mutation, no migration, infinitely large population (no drift), and random mating.</p>

            <p>Use cases: estimating allele frequencies from phenotype data, testing whether evolution is occurring at a locus (deviation from expected proportions).</p>

            <h4>Worked example</h4>
            <p>If 9% of a population shows the recessive phenotype (aa), then q<sup>2</sup> = 0.09 so q = 0.3 and p = 0.7. Expected heterozygote frequency = 2pq = 2(0.7)(0.3) = 0.42 (42%).</p>

            <h3>Checkpoint</h3>
            <ol class="checkpoints">
                <li>Show how to calculate p and q when q<sup>2</sup> = 0.04.</li>
                <li>List the five conditions required for Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium.</li>
                <li>Explain one biological scenario that would cause departure from Hardy–Weinberg proportions.</li>

        <section id="selection" class="section">
            <h2>Natural Selection & Adaptation</h2>
            <p>Natural selection is the differential survival and reproduction of individuals due to differences in phenotype. Fitness (w) quantifies reproductive success; relative fitness is often used to compare genotypes.</p>

            <p>Selection coefficient (s) measures the strength of selection against a genotype (w = 1 - s). For example, if genotype AA has fitness 1, and aa has fitness 1 - s, then s is the proportional reduction in fitness.</p>

            <p>Types of selection:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Directional selection — shifts the mean phenotype in one direction.</li>
                <li>Stabilizing selection — favors intermediate phenotypes and reduces variance.</li>
                <li>Disruptive selection — favors extremes and can increase variance or lead to speciation.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Selection interacts with mutation, migration, and genetic drift. In small populations drift can overcome weak selection.</p>

        <section id="phylogenetics" class="section">
            <h2>Phylogenetics & Tree Building</h2>
            <p>Phylogenetics reconstructs evolutionary relationships between species (or genes) using shared traits, which can be morphological or molecular. Key concepts include homology (shared ancestry) and analogy (convergent similarity).</p>

            <p>Common tree-building methods:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Distance methods (e.g., Neighbor-Joining) — use pairwise distances.</li>
                <li>Maximum parsimony — finds the tree with minimal character changes.</li>
                <li>Maximum likelihood / Bayesian inference — use explicit models of sequence evolution (most powerful for molecular data).</li>
            </ul>

            </div>

            <p>Important: an evolutionary tree's topology (branching order) is the key statement of relationships; branch lengths may represent genetic change or time.</p>

        <section id="speciation" class="section">
            <h2>Speciation & Macroevolution</h2>
            <p>Speciation is the process by which one lineage splits into two reproductively isolated lineages. Modes of speciation:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Allopatric — geographic isolation creates barriers to gene flow.</li>
                <li>Sympatric — speciation without geographic separation (e.g., polyploidy in plants).</li>
                <li>Parapatric — adjacent populations diverge due to environmental gradients.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Reproductive isolating mechanisms can be prezygotic (behavioral, temporal, mechanical, gametic) or postzygotic (hybrid inviability or sterility).</p>
